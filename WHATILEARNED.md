What i learned from this project:

1. That i needed more div's than i thought i did
2. How to create a dropdown menu and make it "drop-up"
3. How div's give you the spacing you need to style elements nicely
4. How to make and delete Branches using Git in the terminal, so i wasn't always working on Main
5. I didn't correct it in this project yet but i did learn the right way to make a head and body for the html
6. How to style (still tough for me, i'm not super creative)
7. How to link Javascript and the CSS into the html
8. How to use Javascript even though it was mostly copy and paste, reminded me of c++
